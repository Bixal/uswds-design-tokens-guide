## Getting Started
This template can be used as a starting point for adopting the use of color tokens in your design systems in Figma. 

In this file youâ€™ll find the [theme color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/theme-tokens/) and [state color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/state-tokens/) as defined by USWDS. 

The tokens are customizable for your projects, so use this file as a base to help you organize and name your tokens to align with USWDS guidance. 

Each color token is saved as a color style. Each color style is named by the theme or state color token associated with it and includes a description that names the [system token](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/) and the [settings](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/) variable that it is referencing. 

## How to use this template
1. Duplicate [color token template file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1024394345443465950). Rename the file and move it from your drafts to your team folder.
