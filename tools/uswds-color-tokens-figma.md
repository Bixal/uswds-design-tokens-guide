## How to use the template
This template can be used as a starting point for adopting the use of color tokens in you design systems in Figma. 

In this file youâ€™ll find the [theme color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/theme-tokens/) and [state color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/state-tokens/) as defined by USWDS. 

The tokens are customizable for your projects, so use this file as a base to help you organize and name your tokens to align with USWDS guidance. 

Each color token is saved as a color style. Each color style is named by the theme or state color token associated with it and includes a description that names the [system token](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/) and the [settings[(https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/)] variable that it is referencing. 

Deselect all layers by clicking outside of a frame and you will see all the color styles listed in the right side panel.
