## Getting Started
This template can be used as a starting point for adopting the use of color tokens in your design systems in Figma. 

- In this file youâ€™ll find the [theme color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/theme-tokens/) and [state color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/state-tokens/) as defined by USWDS. 
- The tokens are customizable for your projects, so use this file as a base to help you organize and name your tokens to align with USWDS guidance. 
- Each color token is saved as a color style. 
- Each color style is named by the theme or state color token associated with it and includes a description that names the [system token](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/) and the [settings](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/) variable that it is referencing. 
- Dupllicate and rename this file to start using the template for your projects.
