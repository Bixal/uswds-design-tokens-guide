# {{ page.title }}

The [USWDS component library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/836611771720754351) is available and free to use through the Figma Community created by the [Truss.works team](https://truss.works/).

Not only will you be able to incorporate components into your designs, but it's a great place to start understanding how these components are created from design tokens.

## Getting started

### Duplicating the USWDS component library

To view and duplicate files from the Figma Community, login or create a [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/).

1. Navigate to the community tab in the left-hand side navigation.
1. Search for "USWDS" in the search bar.
1. Open the USWDS file by Truss.
1. Duplicate the file.

### Publishing the library

You've successfully duplicated the library! Now you can publish this file and apply it across all your project files.

## Crafting designs 

Not sure where to start or need inspiration? 

We've gone ahead and created some [page templates](https://bixal.github.io/uswds-page-templates/) using the USWDS components library. You can view how they respond in the web or view their Figma files to dive a little deeper.

<!-- ## Pro tips
- You can make changes to any of the components on your duplicated library file without affecting Truss's original file.  -->

## Things to keep in mind
- Whichever version of the library you duplicated from Truss will **not** receive any new updates automatically.
- The only way to get the newest version would be to duplicate the updated library from the Figma Community page.
- If you have files or projects already linked to an older version, you may need to relink components if you want to move to an updated library version.

### Our suggestions
- **Keep your USWDS component library in its own file.** If your team or projects have multiple files referencing this library, it's best to keep it separate.
- **Stick to a single version.** This will help you avoid continuous relinking of components.
