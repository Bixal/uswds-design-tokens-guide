# {{ page.title }}

Created by the [Truss.works team](https://truss.works/), the [USWDS component library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/836611771720754351) is available and free to use through the Figma community. This is a great place to start so you can get a real sense of how your wireframes will look with USWDS components.

## Things to keep in mind:

- Whichever version of the library you duplicate from Truss will **not** receive any new updates automatically.
- The only way to get the newest version would be to duplicate the updated library from the Figma community page.
	- Know the current version
	- Check when this library was last updated
- If you have files or projects already linked to an older version, tedious relinking may occur if you're wanting to move to an updated library version.

## Our suggestion:

- **Keep your USWDS component library in it's own file.** If your team or projects have multiple files referencing from this library, it's best to keep it separate.
- **Stick to a single version.** We think it's best to stick to a single version of the USWDS components (currently 2.12) and linking your team or project files to it. By adding any future updated duplicates from Truss will involve tedious relinking of components.
