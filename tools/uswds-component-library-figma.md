# {{ page.title }}

The [USWDS component library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/836611771720754351) is available and free to use through the Figma Community. Created by the [Truss.works team](https://truss.works/), it's a great place to start incorporating components into your designs.

## Getting started

### Duplicating the USWDS component library

## Start crafting designs 

Not sure where to start or need inspiration? 

We've gone ahead and created some page templates using the USWDS components library. Check them out [here](#)!
<!--Will need to link to USWDS page templates later-->

<!-- ## Pro tips:
- You can make changes to any of the components on your duplicated library file without affecting Truss's original file.  -->

## Things to keep in mind:
- Whichever version of the library you duplicated from Truss will **not** receive any new updates automatically.
- The only way to get the newest version would be to duplicate the updated library from the Figma Community page.
- If you have files or projects already linked to an older version, tedious relinking may occur if you're wanting to move to an updated library version.

### Our suggestions:
- **Keep your USWDS component library in it's own file.** If your team or projects have multiple files referencing from this library, it's best to keep it separate.
- **Stick to a single version.** It's best to stick to a single version of the USWDS components library to avoid continuous relinking of components.
