- Utility classes are how the Design System translates between the language of design tokens and the browser.
- For example, `base-dark` is defined in the Design System, but applying the CSS class of `text-base-dark` or `border-base-dark` is how you apply that color token to an element on a web page.
- It's helpful to be aware of utility classes and what they offer because you can reference them in your design files or documentation to make your intent clear to developers.
