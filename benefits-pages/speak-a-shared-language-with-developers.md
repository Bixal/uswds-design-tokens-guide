- This is not about designers learning to code, or developers learning to design for that matter.
- Using design tokens helps both designers and developers feel comfortable that they're talking about the same thing.
- The Design System has its own lexicon; trying to use it this knowledge is like trying to navigate a foreign city where you don't know the language.
- Using the language of design tokens helps designers better communicate their intent and raise their expectations for the level of implementation quality.
