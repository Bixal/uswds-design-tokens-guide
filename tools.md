## USWDS Component Library in Figma

## Figma tokens plug-in
#### What is Figma Tokens? ####
- Figma Tokens allows you to integrate tokens into your design system.
- There are three approaches to begin using the Tokens plugin:
  1. Create your tokens from scratch, 
  2. Import your existing styles into the Tokens plugin, 
  3. Or create tokens using the built-in JSON editor. 

#### Importing tokens ####
- If you're working with an existing design system where you've already defined font styles, colors, spacing, etc., then use the import feature to generate tokens based on those existing styles. 
- This can be the easiest way to start using tokens because the plugin will auto-generate the tokens based on what you have in your system, instead of starting from nothing.

- After importing existing styles to create tokens, you can adjust the token names with your developer and come up with the naming conventions that make the most senese for you.

- If your developer is already using tokens, you can use the JSON editor in the tokens plugin to import and begin designing from what they already have.
