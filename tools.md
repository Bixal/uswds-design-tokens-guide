## USWDS Component Library in Figma

## Figma tokens plug-in

#### What is Figma Tokens? ####
- Figma Tokens allows you to integrate tokens into your design system.
- You can either start creating your tokens from scratch or import your existing styles into the Tokens Plugin. 

#### Importing tokens ####
- If you're working with an existing design system where you've already defined font styles, colors, spacing, etc., then use the import feature to generate tokens based on those existing styles. 
- This can be the easiest way to start using tokens because the plug in will auto-generate the tokens based on what you have in your system so you don't need to start from scartch. 
- From there, you can go in and adjust the token names with your developer to come up with the naming conventions that make the most senese for you.
- If your developer is already using tokens, you can use the JSON editor in the tokens plugin to import and begin designing from what they already have.
