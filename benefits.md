## Focus on the important stuff

- By using the Design System and the "smart defaults" that are baked in as design tokens, you don't have to create and define everything from scratch.
- Building on this existing foundation, you can think more about what the unique needs of the project are and how you can bring out the identity of the client in the design.

## Adopt a responsive-first mindset

- The Design System takes a mobile-first approach, but we obviously have to consider more contexts.
- By considering design tokens in their various screen size breakpoint contexts, you can be more proactive about considering the user experience at any screen size.
- When you're able to bring this design work into the browser, it's even more powerful tool for responsive design since it answers many questions that not feasible or possible in design tools.

## Speak a shared language with developers

- This is not about designers learning to code, or developers learning to design for that matter.
- Using design tokens helps both designers and developers feel comfortable that they're talking about the same thing.
- The Design System has its own lexicon; trying to use it this knowledge is like trying to navigate a foreign city where you don't know the language.
- Using the language of design tokens helps designers better communicate their intent and raise their expectations for the level of implementation quality.

## Make decisions easier and more consistent

- One you have made foundational decisions about the design language of your project (typography, color, spacing, etc.), design tokens provide useful constraints for subsequent decisions.
- Instead of leaving every screen or design element open to a universe of options, you can start with a smaller collection that will make the design feel more cohesive.
- By working from that collection, there is less opportunity to make accidental mistakes of inconsistency.
- While designing with tokens makes things easier, you always have the option to diverage when necessary to achieve a particular effect.
