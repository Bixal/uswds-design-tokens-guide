- One you have made foundational decisions about the design language of your project (typography, color, spacing, etc.), design tokens provide useful constraints for subsequent decisions.
- Instead of leaving every screen or design element open to a universe of options, you can start with a smaller collection that will make the design feel more cohesive.
- By working from that collection, there is less opportunity to make accidental mistakes of inconsistency.
- While designing with tokens makes things easier, you always have the option to diverage when necessary to achieve a particular effect.
