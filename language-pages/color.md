- Understanding color grades and accessibility
- Defining theme and state tokens (unless they don't work for your project)
- Unless you have to use specific brand color values, consider using colors from the system token palette to benefit from the accessible contrast features.
  - Use the [USWDS Color Tool](https://civicactions.github.io/uswds-color-tool/) from Civic Actions to find system token colors similar to existing colors on a project that you may want to migrate.
