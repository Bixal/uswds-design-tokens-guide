From [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/):

> _Design tokens are a limited set of discrete options, just like a scale of musical notes is drawn from the spectrum of all possible frequencies. Or like the presets on a car radio â€” not every option, just a specific selection._

- A token is a set of name and value pairs.
- The names are the words we use in our design that make it easier to understand and apply those _discrete options_.
- For example, instead of describing our type using pixel sizes, we use t-shirt sizes, like `sm`, `md`, and `lg`. When describing colors, we use palettes based on their function, like `primary-dark` or `warning-light.`
- The value of the pair is set to a default, but it can be changed if needed.
